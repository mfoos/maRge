## Marge for R

My name starts with "ma" and I've been doing a lot of merges lately and I keep
misspelling it "marge". I figured the world would be a better place if a tiny
Marge Simpson popped up instead of an anticlimactic error message.

Like this `@@@:-)`

Ideally one day she will say things.

[P]UPDATE 2/26/2016:

One-line Marge is deprecated! All glories to ASCII Marge!

If you give her a string, she'll say that, but otherwise, she sticks to my
favorite Marge line of all time.

### Installing
1. Install & load the devtools R package
2. Open an R session and type `install_github("mfoos/maRge")`

#### Thanks!
Thanks to Hilary Parker for her [great
write-up](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) on how to make an R package and [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) for telling me that there are no raw strings in R before I hurt myself trying to use real ascii art. Thanks also to [Scott Chamberlain](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay) for nailing cowsay in R and bringing the dream back to life.
